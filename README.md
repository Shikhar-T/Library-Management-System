# Library Management System

## Overview
This is a comprehensive Library Management System built using SQL, which includes multiple tables and queries to manage books, members, employees, branches, issued and returned books, and their corresponding status. The system allows for operations such as creating, updating, and deleting records, as well as generating reports and summaries based on specific requirements.

## Database Schema
The following tables have been created for managing the library data:

1. **Branch** - Stores information about the library branches.
2. **Employee** - Stores employee details.
3. **Books** - Stores book details in the library.
4. **Members** - Stores information about library members.
5. **Issued Status** - Tracks the issued books to members.
6. **Return Status** - Tracks the returned books.

## Objectives of Each Task

### Task 1: Create a New Book Record
- **Objective**: Insert a new book ("To Kill a Mockingbird") into the books table with details like ISBN, title, category, rental price, availability, author, and publisher.

### Task 2: Update an Existing Member's Address
- **Objective**: Update the address of a specific library member (ID 'C101').

### Task 3: Delete a Record from the Issued Status Table

### Task 4: Retrieve All Books Issued by a Specific Employee
- **Objective**: Retrieve all books issued by an employee with the employee ID 'E101'.

### Task 5: List Members Who Have Issued More Than One Book
- **Objective**: Identify members who have issued more than one book using the `GROUP BY` clause.

### Task 6: Create Summary Tables - Book Issued Count
- **Objective**: Create a summary table showing the count of books issued for each book using the `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT` (CTAS) technique.

### Task 7: Retrieve All Books in a Specific Category
- **Objective**: Fetch all books belonging to a particular category, e.g., 'Classic'.

### Task 8: Find Total Rental Income by Category
- **Objective**: Calculate the total rental income generated by each category of books.

- **Objective**: Fetch members who have registered in the last 180 days.

### Task 10: List Employees with Their Branch Manager's Name and Branch Details
- **Objective**: Retrieve a list of employees along with their branch manager's name and branch details.

### Task 12: Retrieve the List of Books Not Yet Returned
- **Objective**: Fetch all books that are issued but have not been returned yet.

### Task 13: Identify Members with Overdue Books
- **Objective**: Identify members who have overdue books (i.e., not returned within 30 days).

### Task 14: Branch Performance Report
- **Objective**: Generate a performance report for each branch, showing the number of books issued, number of books returned, and total revenue generated.

### Task 15: Create a Table of Active Members
- **Objective**: Use CTAS to create a table containing active members who have issued at least one book in the last 6 months.
